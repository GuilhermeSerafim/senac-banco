Statement Develop two ERDs to represent the following situation. Develop one as a hierarchical structure and one as a recursive structure. 

Curves Dynamics sells products throughout the United States. They are divided into four major sales regions: the Northern,
Eastern, Southern, and Western regions. Each sales region has a unique region code. Each sales region is then divided into sales
districts. For example, the Western Region is divided into the Rocky Mountain, Northwest, Pacific Coast, and Pacific districts. Each
district has a unique district code.
Each district is made up of sales territories. The Rocky Mountain district is composed of three territories: Wyoming-Montana,
Colorado, and Utah-New Mexico. The Northwest district is made up of two territories: the Washington and Oregon-Idaho territories.
The Pacific Coast district is composed of two territories: the California and Nevada territories. The Pacific district includes the
Hawaii territory and the Alaska territory. Each territory has a unique territory code.
Each sales territory is broken down into sales areas. For example, Colorado is made up of two sales areas: the Front Range and
the Western Slope sales areas. Each sales area has a unique sales-area code.
Each salesperson is responsible for one or more sales areas, and has a specific sales quota. Each sales manager is responsible
for one or more sales districts and sales directors who are responsible for one or more sales regions. Each sales manager is
responsible for the territories within his districts. Employees’ responsibilities do not overlap. A sales area is always the
responsibility of a single salesperson, and managers and directors’ responsibilities do not overlap. Sometimes salespersons,
managers, and directors will be on leave or special assignments and will not have sales area responsibilities. All sales personnel
are identified by their employee IDs.
